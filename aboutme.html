<h4>
  ABOUT ME!
</h4>
<h2>
    My passion for journalism began in elementary school. Every morning before school, my mom would have the Today Show on, and I was mesmerized by the anchors and the stories they told. At the time, I had no idea what journalism was, so I didn’t think much about it. That changed in eighth grade when high school counselors visited to help us choose freshman-year classes. And there it was on the elective list— "Intro to Broadcasting."
</h2>

<h2>
  I created countless memories over my four years of exploring the world of broadcast journalism, ultimately working my way up to News Director for the show. My final show senior year was one of my favorites, aswell as the Valentines Day episode where I anchored and was featured in a piece!
